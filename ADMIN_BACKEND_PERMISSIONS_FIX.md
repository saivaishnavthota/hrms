# Admin Backend Permissions Fix

## Issues Identified

### 1. **Access Denied Errors**
Admin users were getting `"Access denied: HR only"` errors when trying to access various endpoints.

### 2. **API Endpoint Errors**
Admin Dashboard was calling `/users/employee/list` which doesn't exist, causing 404 errors with integer parsing issues.

### 3. **Missing Data**
Admin could not view:
- Employee attendance records
- Leave requests (active/past)
- Expense requests (pending/past)
- Employee lists

---

## Fixes Applied

### Backend Route Permissions (`Backend/routes/`)

#### 1. **Document Routes** (`document_routes.py`)
Updated all HR-only checks to include Admin role:

```python
# Before
if current_user.role != "HR":
    raise HTTPException(status_code=403, detail="Access denied: HR only")

# After  
if current_user.role != "HR" and current_user.role != "Admin":
    raise HTTPException(status_code=403, detail="Access denied: HR only")
```

**Fixed Endpoints:**
- ✅ GET `/documents/{employee_id}/document/{doc_type}` - Download employee documents
- ✅ POST `/documents/approve-all-documents` - Approve documents
- ✅ GET `/documents/employees-with-docs` - View employees with documents
- ✅ GET `/documents/request-logs` - View document request logs
- ✅ DELETE `/documents/employee/{employee_id}` - Delete employee documents

---

#### 2. **Onboarding Routes** (`onboarding_routes.py`)
Updated all Super-HR checks to include Admin role:

```python
# Before
if current_user.role != "HR" or not current_user.super_hr:
    raise HTTPException(status_code=403, detail="Access denied: Only Super-HR can...")

# After
if (current_user.role != "HR" or not current_user.super_hr) and current_user.role != "Admin":
    raise HTTPException(status_code=403, detail="Access denied: Only Super-HR or Admin can...")
```

**Fixed Endpoints:**
- ✅ POST `/onboarding/create-employee` - Create new employees
- ✅ GET `/onboarding/get-onboarding-employees` - View onboarding employees
- ✅ POST `/onboarding/approve-employee/{onboarding_id}` - Approve employees
- ✅ POST `/onboarding/assign-employee` - Assign employees to HR/Manager
- ✅ DELETE `/onboarding/reject-employee/{onboarding_id}` - Reject employees
- ✅ DELETE `/onboarding/onboarding-employee/{onboarding_id}` - Delete employees

---

### Frontend Fixes

#### 3. **Admin Dashboard** (`Frontend/src/components/Admin/Dashboard.jsx`)

**Fixed API Endpoint:**
```javascript
// Before (incorrect - endpoint doesn't exist)
const employeesResponse = await api.get('/users/employee/list');
const employees = employeesResponse.data || [];

// After (correct endpoint)
const employeesResponse = await api.get('/users/employees');
const employees = employeesResponse.data?.employees || [];
```

**Added Comprehensive Data Fetching:**
```javascript
// 1. Employee counts
const employeesResponse = await api.get('/users/employees');

// 2. Pending expenses
const expensesResponse = await api.get('/expenses/hr-pending-requests');

// 3. Pending leaves
const leavesResponse = await api.get(`/leave/hr/leave-requests/${userId}`);

// 4. Pending software requests
const swReqResponse = await api.get('/software_requests/');
```
