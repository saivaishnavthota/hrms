# Admin Role Implementation

## Overview
A comprehensive Admin role has been implemented with full access to all features in the application, including HR management, IT Support, and all other modules.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Frontend Authentication (`Frontend/src/lib/auth.js`)
- ✅ Added `isAdmin` flag to `getCurrentUser()` function
- ✅ Admin users automatically get access to all role-based features
- ✅ Admin redirect path set to `/admin/dashboard`
- ✅ Admin role normalized to handle case variations

### 2. Admin Layout Configuration (`Frontend/src/config/admin-layout.config.jsx`)
The Admin menu includes all features:

#### HR Management Features:
- Dashboard
- Employee Management
- Onboarding
- Employee Attendance
- Leave Requests
- Assign Leaves
- Expense Management
- Document Collection
- Projects
- Holidays
- Company Policies

#### IT Management Features:
- Assets
- Vendors
- Allocations
- Maintenance
- Software Requests

#### Configuration:
- HR Configuration
- My Activity

### 3. Admin Dashboard Component (`Frontend/src/components/Admin/Dashboard.jsx`)
Comprehensive dashboard showing:
- **Statistics Cards**:
  - Total Employees
  - Active Employees
  - Pending Expenses
  - Total Assets

- **Quick Actions**: Direct links to all major features
- **Pending Items**: Real-time view of pending approvals
- **System Overview**: Overall system health and statistics

### 4. Routing Configuration (`Frontend/src/routing/app-routing-setup.jsx`)
- ✅ Added complete Admin routing at `/admin/*`
- ✅ Protected with `allowedRoles={["Admin"]}`
- ✅ All HR and IT routes mapped for Admin access

### 5. Backend Role Access Updates

#### Updated Files:
1. **`Backend/routes/hr_config_routes.py`**
   - `check_hr()` now accepts "Admin" role
   - `check_super_hr()` treats Admin as Super HR

2. **`Backend/routes/policy_routes.py`**
   - HR checks now include Admin role

3. **`Backend/routes/expenses_routes.py`**
   - Expense management access granted to Admin

4. **`Backend/routes/user_routes.py`**
   - Employee list filtering works for Admin
   - Admin treated as Super HR for data access

5. **`Backend/routes/document_routes.py`**
   - Document access granted to Admin

6. **`Backend/routes/swreq_routes.py`**
   - Software request management accessible to Admin
   - Admin appears in IT Admins list

## Database Setup

### Creating an Admin User

#### Option 1: Direct Database Insert
```sql
-- Create a new Admin user
INSERT INTO employees (
    name, 
    email, 
    company_email, 
    role, 
    o_status,
    password_hash,
    created_at
) VALUES (
    'System Administrator',
    'admin@company.com',
    'admin@company.com',
    'Admin',
    true,
    '$2b$12$...',  -- Use bcrypt hashed password
    NOW()
);
```

#### Option 2: Update Existing User
```sql
-- Convert existing user to Admin
UPDATE employees 
SET role = 'Admin' 
WHERE id = <user_id>;
```

#### Option 3: Via Python Script
```python
from passlib.context import CryptContext

pwd_context = CryptContext(schemes=["bcrypt"], deprecated="auto")
hashed_password = pwd_context.hash("YourPassword123")

# Then insert into database with hashed_password
```

## Access Control Matrix

| Feature | Employee | Manager | HR | Super HR | IT Admin | **Admin** |
|---------|----------|---------|----|----|----------|-----------|
| Employee Management | ❌ | ⚠️ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Attendance | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Leave Management | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Expense Management | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Documents | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Policies | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| HR Configuration | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Assets | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Vendors | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Allocations | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Maintenance | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Software Requests | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |

Legend:
- ✅ Full Access
- ⚠️ Limited Access (own data or team data)
- ❌ No Access

## Testing the Implementation

### Step 1: Create Admin User
```sql
UPDATE employees SET role = 'Admin' WHERE email = 'your.email@company.com';
```

### Step 2: Login
1. Go to `/login`
2. Enter Admin credentials
3. Should redirect to `/admin/dashboard`

### Step 3: Verify Access
- ✅ Check all menu items are visible
- ✅ Test HR features (Employee Management, Leave Requests, etc.)
- ✅ Test IT features (Assets, Software Requests, etc.)
- ✅ Verify data access across all modules

## Security Considerations

1. **Admin Role Protection**:
   - Only database administrators should be able to create Admin users
   - Limit the number of Admin users to essential personnel
   - Regularly audit Admin access logs

2. **Password Requirements**:
   - Use strong passwords for Admin accounts
   - Enable 2FA if available
   - Rotate Admin passwords regularly

3. **Access Logging**:
   - Monitor Admin actions in the audit trail
   - Review Admin activity regularly
   - Set up alerts for sensitive operations

## API Endpoints Accessible to Admin

All endpoints that check for HR, Manager, or IT Admin roles now also accept Admin:

```
GET /users/employee/list - ✅ Full access
GET /attendance/hr-daily - ✅ Full access
GET /expenses/* - ✅ Full access
GET /leaves/* - ✅ Full access
GET /documents/* - ✅ Full access
GET /policies/* - ✅ Full access
GET /hr-config/* - ✅ Full access
GET /assets/* - ✅ Full access
GET /software_requests/* - ✅ Full access
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Admin user redirects to login
**Solution**: Ensure the role is exactly "Admin" (case-sensitive) in the database

### Issue: Some features not accessible
**Solution**: Clear browser cache and localStorage, then login again

### Issue: Backend returns 403 Forbidden
**Solution**: Check if the specific route has been updated to allow Admin role

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Add Admin-specific analytics dashboard
- [ ] Implement role-based audit logging
- [ ] Add Admin user management interface
- [ ] Create system health monitoring for Admins
- [ ] Implement bulk operations for Admins
