# Admin View-Only Mode Implementation

## Overview
The Admin role now has **view-only access** to Attendance, Leaves, and Expenses. Admin users can view all data but cannot perform any actions (approve, reject, delete, or create new records).

## Changes Made

### 1. **Expense Management** (`Frontend/src/components/HR/ExpenseManagement.jsx`)
- ✅ Added `viewOnly` prop to component
- ✅ Hidden "Add My Expense" button when `viewOnly={true}`
- ✅ Hidden Approve/Reject action buttons when `viewOnly={true}`
- ✅ View button still visible for viewing expense details
- ✅ Added "View Only" badge in header
- ✅ Updated description text for view-only mode

**Actions Hidden:**
- ✅ Add My Expense button
- ✅ Approve button (green checkmark)
- ✅ Reject button (red X)

**Actions Visible:**
- ✅ View Details (eye icon)
- ✅ Download PDF/Excel reports
- ✅ Search and filter functionality

---

### 2. **Leave Requests** (`Frontend/src/components/HR/LeaveRequests.jsx`)
- ✅ Added `viewOnly` prop to component
- ✅ Hidden Delete button when `viewOnly={true}`
- ✅ View button still visible for viewing leave details
- ✅ Added "View Only" badge in header
- ✅ Updated description text for view-only mode

**Actions Hidden:**
- ✅ Delete button (trash icon)

**Actions Visible:**
- ✅ View Details (eye icon)
- ✅ Tab navigation (Pending Requests / Leave Requests)
- ✅ Search and sort functionality

---

### 3. **Employee Attendance** (`Frontend/src/components/HR/EmployeeAttendance.jsx`)
- ✅ Added `viewOnly` prop to component
- ✅ Added "View Only" badge in header
- ✅ Updated description text for view-only mode
- ✅ All existing view functionality preserved

**Note:** Employee Attendance already had no action buttons (only view functionality), so no buttons needed to be hidden.

**Actions Visible:**
- ✅ View Projects modal
- ✅ View Details modal
- ✅ Download PDF/Excel reports
- ✅ Filter by year/month
- ✅ Search and filter functionality

---

### 4. **Admin Routing** (`Frontend/src/routing/app-routing-setup.jsx`)
Updated Admin routes to pass `viewOnly={true}` prop:

```jsx
{/* HR Features - View Only */}
<Route path="employees-attendance" element={<EmployeeAttendance viewOnly={true} />} />
<Route path="leave-requests" element={<LeaveRequests viewOnly={true} />} />
<Route path="expense-management" element={<ExpenseManagement viewOnly={true} />} />
```

---

## Visual Indicators

All view-only components now display a blue badge:

```
Expense Management [View Only]
View all expense claims (read-only access)
```

The badge styling:
- Color: Blue (`text-blue-600 bg-blue-50`)
- Shape: Rounded pill
- Position: Next to the page title
- Font: Small, medium weight

---

## Access Summary

### Admin Can:
✅ View all employee attendance records
✅ View all leave requests
✅ View all expense claims
✅ View detailed information (modals, details pages)
✅ Download reports (PDF/Excel)
✅ Search and filter data
✅ Navigate between tabs and pages

### Admin Cannot:
❌ Approve or reject expenses
❌ Approve or reject leaves
❌ Delete leave requests
❌ Create new expense claims
❌ Modify attendance records
❌ Take any action that changes data

## Testing

To test Admin view-only mode:

1. **Login as Admin**
   ```sql
   UPDATE employees SET role = 'Admin' WHERE email = 'admin@company.com';
   ```

2. **Navigate to each section:**
   - `/admin/employees-attendance` - Should see "View Only" badge
   - `/admin/leave-requests` - Should see "View Only" badge, no delete button
   - `/admin/expense-management` - Should see "View Only" badge, no approve/reject buttons

3. **Verify functionality:**
   - ✅ Can view all data
   - ✅ Can download reports
   - ✅ Can search/filter
   - ✅ Cannot see action buttons (approve/reject/delete/add)

---

## Component Props

All three components now accept an optional `viewOnly` prop:

```jsx
// Default (full access)
<ExpenseManagement />
<LeaveRequests />
<EmployeeAttendance />

// View-only mode
<ExpenseManagement viewOnly={true} />
<LeaveRequests viewOnly={true} />
<EmployeeAttendance viewOnly={true} />
```

---

## Other Roles

**Important:** Only Admin routes pass `viewOnly={true}`. Other roles (HR, Manager) continue to have full functionality:

- **HR Routes** (`/hr/*`) - Full access, no viewOnly prop
- **Super HR Routes** (`/super-hr/*`) - Full access, no viewOnly prop  
- **Manager Routes** (`/manager/*`) - Full access for their team
- **Admin Routes** (`/admin/*`) - View-only access with `viewOnly={true}`

---

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for Admin view-only mode:

- [ ] Add view-only mode to more components (Onboarding, Documents)
- [ ] Add audit logging for Admin views
- [ ] Create Admin-specific analytics without actions
- [ ] Add export functionality for Admin to generate reports
- [ ] Implement time-based access restrictions
