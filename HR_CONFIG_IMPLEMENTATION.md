# HR Configuration Implementation - Leave Categories & Departments

## Overview
Successfully implemented a complete database-backed solution for managing leave categories and departments in the HRMS system. This replaces the previous localStorage-based approach with a robust, centralized database solution.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Models (Backend)
**File:** `Backend/models/hr_config_model.py`

Created two new database tables:

#### LeaveCategory Table
- Stores leave category configurations (e.g., "Sick Leave", "Annual Leave")
- Fields: id, name, default_days, description, is_active, created_by, created_at, updated_at
- Supports soft deletion via `is_active` flag

#### Department Table
- Stores department configurations (e.g., "Engineering", "Sales")
- Fields: id, name, description, is_active, created_by, created_at, updated_at
- Supports soft deletion via `is_active` flag

### 2. API Schemas (Backend)
**File:** `Backend/schemas/hr_config_schema.py`

Created Pydantic schemas for:
- `LeaveCategoryCreate`, `LeaveCategoryUpdate`, `LeaveCategoryResponse`
- `DepartmentCreate`, `DepartmentUpdate`, `DepartmentResponse`

### 3. API Routes (Backend)
**File:** `Backend/routes/hr_config_routes.py`

Implemented complete CRUD operations:

#### Leave Categories Endpoints
- `GET /hr-config/leave-categories` - List all active leave categories
- `GET /hr-config/leave-categories/{id}` - Get specific category
- `POST /hr-config/leave-categories` - Create new category (Super HR only)
- `PUT /hr-config/leave-categories/{id}` - Update category (Super HR only)
- `DELETE /hr-config/leave-categories/{id}` - Soft delete category (Super HR only)

#### Departments Endpoints
- `GET /hr-config/departments` - List all active departments
- `GET /hr-config/departments/{id}` - Get specific department
- `POST /hr-config/departments` - Create new department (Super HR only)
- `PUT /hr-config/departments/{id}` - Update department (Super HR only)
- `DELETE /hr-config/departments/{id}` - Soft delete department (Super HR only)

**Security Features:**
- Super HR role validation for create/update/delete operations
- Duplicate name prevention
- Proper error handling with meaningful messages

### 4. Database Migration
**File:** `Backend/alembic/versions/010_create_leave_categories_and_departments_tables.py`

- Migration script to create both tables with proper indexes
- Includes upgrade and downgrade functions
- Indexes on: name, is_active fields for performance

### 5. Backend Integration
**File:** `Backend/main.py`

- Registered the new router: `app.include_router(hr_config_routes.router)`

### 6. Frontend - HR Config Component
**File:** `Frontend/src/components/HR/HRConfig.jsx`

**Major Changes:**
- Replaced localStorage with API calls
- Added `fetchLeaveCategories()` and `fetchDepartments()` functions
- Updated all CRUD operations to use API endpoints
- Added loading states and error handling
- Improved UX with confirmation dialogs
- Better error messages from backend

**Features:**
- Only Super HR can access and modify configurations
- Real-time updates after create/edit/delete operations
- Proper loading indicators
- Toast notifications for all operations

### 7. Frontend - Assign Leaves Component
**File:** `Frontend/src/components/HR/AssignLeaves.jsx`

**Major Changes:**
- Updated to fetch leave categories from API instead of localStorage
- Displays configured default leave categories in a beautiful info card
- Shows category name and default days for each category
- Responsive grid layout (2-5 columns based on screen size)

**Visual Features:**
- Blue information card with icon
- Grid display of all leave categories
- Shows default days prominently
- Helpful text explaining where to modify defaults

## Benefits of New Implementation

### Before (localStorage)
❌ Data stored in browser only
❌ Lost when cache is cleared
❌ Different data per user/browser
❌ No central management
❌ No backup possible
❌ No audit trail

### After (Database)
✅ Centralized data storage
✅ Persistent across all browsers/devices
✅ All users see same data
✅ Central management by Super HR
✅ Automatic database backups
✅ Full audit trail (created_by, created_at, updated_at)
✅ Soft delete capability
✅ Proper access control
✅ Better performance with indexes

## How to Use

### 1. Run Database Migration
```bash
cd Backend
alembic upgrade head
```

### 2. Access HR Configuration
1. Log in as Super HR
2. Navigate to HR Configuration page
3. Add leave categories (e.g., Sick Leave: 6 days, Annual Leave: 15 days)
4. Add departments (e.g., Engineering, Sales, HR)

### 3. View in Assign Leaves
1. Navigate to Assign Leaves page
2. See configured default leave categories displayed at the top
3. Use the assign default leaves button to apply these defaults to employees

## API Testing

### Create Leave Category
```bash
POST http://localhost:8000/hr-config/leave-categories?hr_id=1
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "Sick Leave",
  "default_days": 6,
  "description": "Sick leave for illness"
}
```

### Get All Leave Categories
```bash
GET http://localhost:8000/hr-config/leave-categories
```

### Create Department
```bash
POST http://localhost:8000/hr-config/departments?hr_id=1
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "Engineering",
  "description": "Software development team"
}
```

## Database Schema

### leave_categories Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE leave_categories (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    default_days INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    description TEXT,
    is_active BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT true,
    created_by INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES employees(id),
    created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);
CREATE INDEX ix_leave_categories_name ON leave_categories(name);
CREATE INDEX ix_leave_categories_is_active ON leave_categories(is_active);
```

### departments Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE departments (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    is_active BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT true,
    created_by INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES employees(id),
    created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);
CREATE INDEX ix_departments_name ON departments(name);
CREATE INDEX ix_departments_is_active ON departments(is_active);
```

## Files Created/Modified

### Created Files

2. `Backend/schemas/hr_config_schema.py` - API schemas
3. `Backend/routes/hr_config_routes.py` - API routes
4. `Backend/alembic/versions/010_create_leave_categories_and_departments_tables.py` - Migration

### Modified Files
1. `Backend/main.py` - Added router registration
2. `Frontend/src/components/HR/HRConfig.jsx` - API integration
3. `Frontend/src/components/HR/AssignLeaves.jsx` - API integration + display

## Future Enhancements

### Possible Additions
1. **Employee-Department Assignment**
   - Add `department_id` field to employees table
   - Filter employees by department

2. **Leave Category Rules**
   - Different default days based on employee type
   - Carry forward rules
   - Encashment rules

3. **Department Hierarchy**
   - Parent-child department relationships
   - Department managers

4. **Bulk Operations**
   - Import leave categories from CSV
   - Bulk department creation

5. **Analytics**
   - Leave category usage statistics
   - Department-wise leave reports

## Notes

- All delete operations are soft deletes (sets `is_active = False`)
- Only Super HR can create/update/delete configurations
- Regular HR and employees can view configurations
- Duplicate names are prevented at database level
- All timestamps are automatically managed

## Migration from localStorage

If you have existing data in localStorage, it will no longer be used. You'll need to:
1. Manually re-enter leave categories via HR Config page
2. Manually re-enter departments via HR Config page

The new system provides much better reliability and data persistence.
