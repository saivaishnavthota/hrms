# Regular HR Restrictions Implementation

## Overview
Further restricted regular HR capabilities to prevent them from adding employees or accessing onboarding features. Only Super-HR can perform these administrative tasks.

## Changes Summary

### üîí Backend Security Updates

#### 1. Onboarding Routes Protection
**File**: `Backend/routes/onboarding_routes.py`

All onboarding-related endpoints now require Super-HR access:

| Endpoint | Access | Error Code |
|----------|--------|------------|
| `POST /onboarding/hr/create_employee` | Super-HR only | 403 |
| `GET /onboarding/all` | Super-HR only | 403 |
| `POST /onboarding/hr/approve/{id}` | Super-HR only | 403 |
| `POST /onboarding/hr/assign` | Super-HR only | 403 |
| `DELETE /onboarding/hr/reject/{id}` | Super-HR only | 403 |
| `DELETE /onboarding/hr/delete/{id}` | Super-HR only | 403 |

**Protection Pattern**:
```python
# Only super-HR can perform action
if current_user.role != "HR" or not current_user.super_hr:
    raise HTTPException(
        status_code=403, 
        detail="Access denied: Only Super-HR can [action]"
    )
```

### üé® Frontend UI Updates

#### 2. Employee Management Component
**File**: `Frontend/src/components/HR/EmployeeManagement.jsx`

**Changes**:
- **Add Employee Button**: Hidden for regular HRs
- Uses `isSuperHR` check to conditionally render
- Only Super-HR sees the green "+ Add Employee" button

**Code**:
```jsx
{isSuperHR && (
  <button onClick={() => setIsModalOpen(true)}>
    <UserPlus className="h-5 w-5" />
    Add Employee
  </button>
)}
```

#### 3. HR Sidebar Menu Filtering
**New File**: `Frontend/src/components/layouts/HRLayoutWrapper.jsx`

**Purpose**: Dynamically filter sidebar menu based on Super-HR status

**Logic**:
- **Super-HR**: Sees all menu items (including "Onboarding Employees")
- **Regular HR**: "Onboarding Employees" menu item is hidden

**Implementation**:
```jsx
const filteredMenu = useMemo(() => {
  if (isSuperHR) {
    return MENU_SIDEBAR; // All items
  }
  // Filter out Onboarding Employees
  return MENU_SIDEBAR.filter(item => 
    item.title !== 'Onboarding Employees'
  );
}, [isSuperHR]);
```

#### 4. Routing Updates
**File**: `Frontend/src/routing/app-routing-setup.jsx`

**Changes**:
- HR routes now use `HRLayoutWrapper` instead of `Layout1`
- Menu filtering happens automatically based on user's super_hr status
- Regular HRs trying to navigate to `/hr/onboarding-employees` will see the page but get 403 errors on API calls

## Feature Comparison

### Super-HR Can:
‚úÖ View all employees  
‚úÖ View all employee documents  
‚úÖ **Add new employees**  
‚úÖ Assign employees to managers/HRs/locations  
‚úÖ **View onboarding employees tab**  
‚úÖ **Approve/reject onboarding employees**  
‚úÖ **View onboarding documents**  
‚úÖ Edit and delete employees  

### Regular HR Can:
‚úÖ View assigned employees only  
‚úÖ View assigned employees' documents only  
‚ùå **Cannot add new employees** (button hidden)  
‚ùå **Cannot see "Onboarding Employees" menu**  
‚ùå **Cannot view onboarding employees**  
‚ùå **Cannot approve/reject onboarding**  
‚ùå **Cannot view onboarding documents**  
‚ùå Cannot assign employees  
‚ùå Cannot edit or delete employees  

## Security Layers

### 1. UI Layer (User Experience)
- Menu items hidden
- Buttons conditionally rendered
- Provides clear user interface

### 2. API Layer (Backend Security)
- All protected endpoints check `current_user.super_hr`
- Returns 403 Forbidden for unauthorized access
- Cannot be bypassed through direct API calls

### 3. Route Protection
- Frontend routes protected with role-based access
- Backend validates on every request

## Testing Checklist

### Super-HR Testing:
- [ ] Login as Super-HR
- [ ] Verify "Add Employee" button is visible in Employee Management
- [ ] Verify "Onboarding Employees" menu item is visible
- [ ] Successfully create a new employee
- [ ] Successfully access onboarding employees list
- [ ] Successfully approve an onboarding employee
- [ ] Successfully reject an onboarding employee

### Regular HR Testing:
- [ ] Login as Regular HR
- [ ] Verify "Add Employee" button is **hidden**
- [ ] Verify "Onboarding Employees" menu item is **hidden**
- [ ] Attempt to access `/hr/onboarding-employees` directly (should get errors)
- [ ] Attempt to call onboarding API endpoints (should get 403)
- [ ] Verify only assigned employees are visible
- [ ] Verify can view assigned employees' documents only

## Error Messages

All onboarding-related errors return consistent messages:

| Action | Error Message |
|--------|--------------|
| Create Employee | "Access denied: Only Super-HR can create employees" |
| View Onboarding | "Access denied: Only Super-HR can view onboarding employees" |
| Approve | "Access denied: Only Super-HR can approve onboarding employees" |
| Assign | "Access denied: Only Super-HR can assign employees" |
| Reject | "Access denied: Only Super-HR can reject onboarding employees" |
| Delete | "Access denied: Only Super-HR can delete onboarding employees" |

## Files Modified

### Backend:
- `Backend/routes/onboarding_routes.py` - Added Super-HR checks to all HR onboarding endpoints

### Frontend:
- `Frontend/src/components/HR/EmployeeManagement.jsx` - Hid Add Employee button
- `Frontend/src/components/layouts/HRLayoutWrapper.jsx` - **NEW** - Menu filtering wrapper
- `Frontend/src/routing/app-routing-setup.jsx` - Use HRLayoutWrapper for HR routes

## Migration Notes

No database changes required. All changes are code-level only.

## Backward Compatibility

- Existing Super-HRs (with `super_hr = TRUE`) retain all access
- Existing Regular HRs (with `super_hr = FALSE` or `NULL`) automatically get restricted access
- No data migration needed

## Future Enhancements

1. Add audit logging for Super-HR actions
2. Add notification when regular HR tries to access restricted features
3. Add permission delegation (temporary Super-HR access)
4. Add bulk employee creation for Super-HR
5. Add approval workflow configuration
