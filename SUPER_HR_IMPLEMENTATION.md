# Super-HR Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented a hierarchical HR system with Super-HR having elevated access to assign employees, while regular HRs can only view employees and documents assigned to them.

## Backend Changes

### 1. Database Schema
**File**: `Backend/models/user_model.py`
- Added `super_hr` field (Optional[bool], default=False) to User model

**File**: `Backend/alembic/versions/008_add_super_hr_field.py`
- Created migration to add `super_hr` column to employees table
- Column defaults to FALSE for all existing and new HRs

### 2. API Response Schema
**File**: `Backend/schemas/user_schema.py`
- Added `super_hr` field to `UserResponse` schema

**File**: `Backend/routes/user_routes.py`
- Updated login endpoint to include `super_hr` in response (line 79)
- Returns `super_hr` flag only for HR role users

### 3. Employee List Filtering
**File**: `Backend/routes/user_routes.py`

#### `/employees` endpoint (lines 273-331)
- Added `current_user` dependency
- **Super-HR**: Can see all employees OR filter by specific HR
- **Regular HR**: Only sees employees assigned to them
- Automatically filters based on `super_hr` status

#### `/onboarded-employees` endpoint (lines 329-419)
- Added `current_user` dependency
- **Super-HR**: Sees all onboarded employees
- **Regular HR**: Only sees employees where they are assigned as HR
- Filters using SQL WHERE clause: `eh.hr_id = :hr_id`

### 4. Document Access Control
**File**: `Backend/routes/document_routes.py`

#### `/all-documents` endpoint (lines 365-423)
- **Super-HR**: Can view ALL employee documents
- **Regular HR**: Only documents of assigned employees
- Uses `EmployeeHR` table to filter by assignment

### 5. Assignment Protection
**File**: `Backend/routes/onboarding_routes.py`

#### `/hr/assign` endpoint (lines 631-642)
- Added authorization check before assignment
- **Only Super-HR** can assign employees to managers, HRs, and locations
- Returns 403 Forbidden for regular HRs attempting assignment
- Error message: "Access denied: Only Super-HR can assign employees"

## Frontend Changes

### 1. User Context
**File**: `Frontend/src/contexts/UserContext.jsx`
- Added `super_hr` field to user data storage (line 58)
- Persists `super_hr` flag in localStorage with other user data

### 2. Employee Management Component
**File**: `Frontend/src/components/HR/EmployeeManagement.jsx`

- Added `useUser` hook import
- Added `isSuperHR` constant to check user status
- **Conditional Rendering**:
  - **All HRs**: Can view employee details (View button)
  - **Super-HR Only**: Can assign/edit employees (Edit button) and delete employees
  - **Regular HR**: Edit and Delete buttons are hidden

### 3. Automatic Backend Filtering
- Dashboard and other HR components automatically receive filtered data
- No frontend changes needed as backend handles filtering
- Document Collection automatically shows only assigned employees' documents

## User Experience

### Super-HR Can:
✅ View ALL employees
✅ View ALL employee documents  
✅ Assign employees to managers, HRs, and locations
✅ Set Date of Joining (DOJ) and company employee ID
✅ Edit employee assignments  
✅ Delete employees

### Regular HR Can:
✅ View employees assigned to them  
✅ View documents of assigned employees ONLY  
❌ Cannot assign employees  
❌ Cannot edit assignments  
❌ Cannot delete employees  
❌ Cannot view other HRs' employees or documents

## Database Migration

### To Apply Migration:
```bash
cd Backend
alembic upgrade head
```

### To Set a User as Super-HR:
```sql
UPDATE employees 
SET super_hr = TRUE 
WHERE id = <hr_employee_id> AND role = 'HR';
```

## Testing Checklist

### Super-HR Testing:
- [ ] Login as Super-HR and verify `super_hr: true` in response
- [ ] Verify all employees are visible in Employee Management
- [ ] Verify Edit/Assign buttons are visible
- [ ] Successfully assign an employee
- [ ] View all documents in Document Collection
- [ ] Dashboard shows all employees

### Regular HR Testing:
- [ ] Login as Regular HR and verify `super_hr: false` or null
- [ ] Verify only assigned employees are visible
- [ ] Verify Edit/Delete buttons are hidden
- [ ] Attempt to assign employee via API (should get 403)
- [ ] View documents - only assigned employees visible
- [ ] Dashboard shows only assigned employees

## API Endpoints Summary

| Endpoint | Super-HR Access | Regular HR Access |
|----------|----------------|-------------------|
| GET `/users/employees` | All employees | Only assigned employees |
| GET `/users/onboarded-employees` | All employees | Only assigned employees |
| GET `/documents/all-documents` | All documents | Only assigned employees' documents |
| POST `/onboarding/hr/assign` | ✅ Allowed | ❌ Forbidden (403) |

## Security Considerations

1. **Backend Enforcement**: All access control is enforced at the backend
2. **Token-based**: Uses current_user from JWT token
3. **SQL Filtering**: Filters at database level for performance
4. **Frontend UI**: Hides buttons but backend still validates
5. **No Bypass**: Regular HR cannot bypass restrictions even with API calls

## Future Enhancements

1. Add UI indicator showing which HR is Super-HR in admin panel
2. Add ability to promote/demote HR to Super-HR from admin interface
3. Add audit logging for Super-HR actions
4. Add bulk assignment feature for Super-HR
5. Add delegation feature (Super-HR can temporarily delegate permissions)
